Here is a detailed guide for using all three versions of Medbot


You first need to install all the required modules on your window system.
Once you have everting setup just run the "Medbot_CLI.py" file.

(1) You'll be greeted by the Medbot with appropriate timing ie Morning, Afternoon,Evening

(2) It'll then ask you to tell the medicine name.

(3) Once it has recognized told names it'll show you the name that It has detected and will 
    proceed for asking the schedule you gotta tell it in the format of like one-zero-one, one-zero-zero etc OR one-hundred-one, one-hundred-eleven etc. or in hindi like "एक सौ एक",
    "एक सौ दस" only.
    i.e. out of ['001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111']. Otherwise it'll throw an error
    that not in the possible schedule because only above mentioned schedules are possible.
    where first position denotes the Morning, second denotes Afternoon and third one denotes Evening.

(4) After taking schedule as input it'll display the detected schedule and medicine name and 
    will ask "Are the details correct? [YES / NO]", you should reply in either yes or no 

    If you say no it'll get reset and again ask you for medicine name like from the start
    and if you yes then it'll ask you for "Do you want to add more medicines ?" and you can

    add more medicines with their schedule like we did in step 1 to 3.

    Once you choose to no it will display finally all your medicine names and 
    their corresponding schedules and will ask you to exit by pressing enter.


    

The working of other two ie Web and GUI is quite similar !!
